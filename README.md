# About project
spsh2 is a comprehensive e-commerce platform built with laravel that supports both physical and digital product sales. It features an integrated wallet system so that users can recharge their wallet and make purchases seamlessly.

This project is the same as [spsh](Https://GitHub.com/yacn114/spsh), but written with Laravel and is much more secure and professional than it.
